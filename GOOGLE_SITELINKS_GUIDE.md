# Google Sitelinks Implementation Guide

## ✅ What We've Implemented for Google Sitelinks

### 1. **Structured Navigation Data (JSON-LD)**
Added comprehensive navigation schema markup that tells Google about your site structure:

```json
{
  "@type": "SiteNavigationElement",
  "name": "Main Navigation", 
  "hasPart": [
    {
      "@type": "SiteNavigationElement",
      "name": "About",
      "description": "Learn about Afrainity Technologies",
      "url": "https://afrainity.com#about"
    },
    // ... more navigation items
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Clear Site Hierarchy**
- **Homepage** (Priority 1.0) - Main landing page
- **Services Page** (Priority 0.9) - `/services` - Dedicated services overview
- **Contact Page** (Priority 0.9) - `/contact` - Contact information and form
- **Section Links** (Priority 0.7-0.8) - `#about`, `#solutions`, `#why-choose-us`

### 3. **Enhanced Sitemap.xml**
Updated sitemap with proper priorities and change frequencies:
- Homepage gets highest priority (1.0)
- Important pages get high priority (0.9)
- Section anchors get medium priority (0.7-0.8)

### 4. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
Implemented structured breadcrumb component with schema markup for better navigation understanding.

### 5. **Internal Linking Structure**
- Clear navigation menu in header
- Call-to-action buttons linking between pages
- Footer links (when implemented)
- Cross-page navigation
